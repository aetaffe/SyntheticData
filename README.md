# SyntheticData

The goal of this project is to improve YOLOv8's performance on segmenting the FLIm aiming beam in 
surgical videos by generating synthetic data. I am generating the data using GANs and Diffusion.
The following model were or will be tested:

#### GANs
1. DCGAN
2. Stylegan2-ada

#### Diffusion
1. Latent Diffusion
